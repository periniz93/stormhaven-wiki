## Faction Benefits

Aligning with a faction in Stormhaven provides concrete advantages beyond simple friendship. Each group offers unique once-per-session perks to members in good standing.

### Why Alliances Matter

Stormhaven does not mourn the lost. Pledging to a faction means more than a badge; it buys eyes in the rain, a cot when your wounds reopen, and friends who will drag you off the cobbles before the gutters do. The city will not shed a tear if you vanish—make sure someone is watching your back.

### Once-Per-Session Faction Perks

| Faction | Once-Per-Session Edge |
|---------|----------------------|
| Stormcaller Synod | Calm a willing creature's mind: end frightened or charmed by offering counsel and a shared prayer |
| Artificers' Guild | Declare an on-hand tool or part that keeps a device running for one scene, even if it should be broken or drained |
| Great Houses | Call in a house token for safe lodging, a guarded carriage, or a sealed invitation within your patron's influence |
| Seekers of the Unknown | Ask, "What's the safest way in or out?" and receive a short, true route or the cost to make it safe |
| Crimson Syndicate | Reveal a nearby safehouse or fence within a five-minute walk that can hide you or move contraband quietly |
| Ward Crews | Rally locals: treat the next crowd interaction as friendly unless you betray them this session |
| Stormwatch | Flash your badge to suspend pursuit or questioning for one scene—paperwork catches up later |

### Using Faction Perks

- **Frequency**: Each perk can be used once per session
- **Requirements**: Must be in good standing with the faction
- **Narrative Weight**: These perks represent calling in favors, using connections, or leveraging faction resources
- **Limits**: Some perks have specific restrictions noted in their descriptions

### Faction Membership

To gain access to these perks, characters must:
1. Complete an initiation or prove their worth to the faction
2. Maintain good standing through continued service or loyalty

Betraying a faction can result in loss of perks, active opposition, or worse.
