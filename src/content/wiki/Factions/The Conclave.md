## Great Houses and the Conclave

Stormhaven's elite society revolves around ten Great Houses, each guarding vast Arc reservoirs beneath its estate. Houses fund daring Underbelly expeditions, sabotage rivals, and host galas that double as battlegrounds for prestige.

Five senior patriarchs form the *Conclave*, a council regulating Arc distribution and issuing exploration licences. While individual nobles bankroll private ventures, the Conclave's favour—or withdrawal of it—decides which hunts rise or fall.

The *Artificers' Guild* walks a precarious line between clerical tradition and noble ambition. Guild masters grant technological favours to whichever patron preserves their independence, but they must at least publically abide by the strictures the Synod places on Arc-Tech development.
