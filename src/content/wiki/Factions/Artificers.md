## Artificers' Guild

The Guild claims every conduit and coil. Apprentice crews bottle Arc for paydays, while masters test inventions that could light wardsâ€”or level them. Impress them with salvage or a clever fix and they will trade tools, schematics, and discreet repairs, so long as you respect their ledgers.

### Joining Perk

Guild members gain access to workshop space, discounted tools and components, and training in Arc-based technology.

### Once-Per-Session Perk

Declare an on-hand tool or part that keeps a device running for one scene, even if it should be broken or drained.

### Philosophy

The Artificers' Guild broke from the Stormcaller Synod generations ago, trading liturgy for engines. They believe innovation and progress serve the city better than prayer alone. Their charter comes from the Conclave, not the temples, and they answer to ledgers rather than omens. To the Guild, Arc is a resource to be harnessed, not a divine gift to be rationed by priests.
