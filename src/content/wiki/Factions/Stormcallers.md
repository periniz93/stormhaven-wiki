## Stormcaller Synod

Stormcaller Synod clergy keep the Eye's cathedrals and dozens of rain-houses across the wards. They mend souls, interpret omens, and broker absolution for storm-touched crimes. Even artificers must request access to temple fonts as petitioners—an everyday reminder that tending the faithful is a separate charge from running the city's engines.

### Joining Perk

Members of the Stormcaller Synod gain access to *druidcraft*, temple libraries, and the authority to provide oversight of wayward Artificers.

### Once-Per-Session Perk

Calm a willing creature's mind: end frightened or charmed by offering counsel and a shared prayer.

### Philosophy

The Stormcaller Synod maintains that the storm is divine, not merely a resource. They perform daily rituals to appease the Storm Pantheon and keep the wards intact. The Artificers' harvesting of Arc is tolerated but viewed with suspicion—each spark borrowed is, in the clergy's view, a debt that will come due.
