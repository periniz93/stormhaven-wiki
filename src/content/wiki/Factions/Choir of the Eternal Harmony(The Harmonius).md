## Choir of the Eternal Harmony

A mystical choir sings not for mere beauty, but to commune with the very fabric of the universe. They call it the Endless Song, for it is a tune that never ends and exists in perfect harmony with the rhythms of the cosmos.

Their gatherings are not ordinary concerts, but transformative experiences with lights, music, and people dancing in ecstatic trance. Their music is meant to heighten the senses, to tune them to the frequencies of the universe and awaken the power within.

As they sing, the Brightgrove comes alive with a kaleidoscope of colors, as if the trees and flowers themselves dance to their beat. The air charges with electricity, and the very ground trembles with the power of their music.

### Purpose

Their songs serve a deeper purpose. By attuning themselves to the rhythms of the universe, they can sense the movements of the Storm Mother and predict her wrath. They can sense when she gathers her forces and warn the city, giving time to prepare and protect against her fury.

The Choir of the Eternal Harmony continues to sing their Endless Song, not just for pleasure but for the safety of the city. Their music is not just sound, but a force that holds back the storm and keeps the city safe.

During the Brightgrove Synapse especially, they attune to the Storm Mother's fundamental frequency with their song.

### Quotes

"The storm may rage outside, but within the walls of the Brightgrove, we are all one voice."

"There's a harmony to everything in this world, if you know where to look."

"Through music, we connect with something greater than ourselves. Something divine."

### The Harmonists

The class of magic users who specialize in providing shared trance and illusion during the Eternal Choir's song in the Brightgrove are known as "Harmonists." They use their magical abilities to create intricate and mesmerizing illusions that accompany the Choir's performance, creating a captivating and immersive experience for all who witness it.

Harmonists are highly respected and sought after, as their abilities are seen as essential to the success of the Choir's performances. They undergo rigorous training to hone their skills, learning to weave intricate illusions that can transport the audience to otherworldly realms and evoke powerful emotions.

Their magic works in tandem with the Choir to create a fully immersive experience. Their illusions are often synchronized with the music and lyrics of the Choir, creating a seamless performance.

Despite their important role, Harmonists often keep a low profile and prefer to remain behind the scenes. They are known for their introspective and meditative personalities, and their ability to create illusions that can inspire profound personal revelations in their audience.

Due to the highly intimate nature of the Harmonists' role, only a select few are trusted to become members of the order. These individuals must undergo rigorous training and testing to ensure they possess the necessary skills and sensitivity.

The Harmonists are highly revered by the Eternal Choir and the citizens of the Brightgrove, and their performances are seen as transformative and deeply spiritual experiences.
