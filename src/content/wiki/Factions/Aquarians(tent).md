## Aquarian Rainwardens

The Aquarian Rainwardens are devoted followers of Aquaria, deity of rain and healing from the Storm Pantheon. They maintain rain-houses and healing sanctuaries throughout the wards, offering free care to those in need.

### Joining Perk

Members receive free cure of mundane ailments at any Aquarian sanctuary.

### Philosophy

The Rainwardens believe that rain is a blessing, not merely weather. They collect rainwater in consecrated cisterns, using it in healing rituals and purification ceremonies. Their work is especially vital in the lower wards, where access to clean water and medical care is limited.

### Motifs

Healing, renewal, compassion, and the nurturing aspect of storms.
