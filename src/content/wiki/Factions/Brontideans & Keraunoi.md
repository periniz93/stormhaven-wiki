## Brontidean Brotherhood

A diverse group of fighters, adventurers, and other beings who share a common reverence for storms. They believe that by embracing thunder and lightning, they can tap into their own inner reserves of strength and courage.

### Joining Perk

Members gain advantage on their first Athletics check made in a storm each session.

### The Keraunoi

Among the Brontideans, there are some who take this belief to an extreme—seeking to push themselves to their limits in their quest for communion with the storm gods. These are known as Keraunoi—a select group of Brontideans known for their daring and adventurous spirit in seeking to "Ride the Lightning." They believe that by subjecting themselves to the raw power of thunder and lightning, they can achieve a state of transcendence that brings them closer to the divine.

Whether through high-risk games or gambling, street brawls or other violent displays, or even more extreme methods like climbing mountains during thunderstorms or flying kites in lightning storms, the Keraunoi are always seeking new ways to test themselves against the forces of nature. Some see them as reckless or foolhardy, but others admire their courage and devotion. The Keraunoi occupy a unique place in Stormhaven's culture—as both its most daring adventurers and its most devout worshippers.
