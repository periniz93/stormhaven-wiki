## Black Salt Seers

The Black Salt Seers are an enigmatic group of oracles who focus their gaze on the inky depths of the infinite ocean. They are free-ranging shamans rather than dogmatic priests, and do not answer to any single deity. Instead, they heed the cacophony of whispers that rise from the unknown depths of the seas.

Chosen by the denizens of the brine to communicate omens and demands to the mortals who skim the surface and reap the ocean's bounty, the Black Salt Seers listen to messages hidden within the chittering of unimaginable sea beasts or the promises rising from hissing vents of the ocean floor. They never know exactly who their directives come from, only that they have been chosen by the inscrutable deep.

### Role in Stormhaven

As harbingers of the seas, the Black Salt Seers instruct their people when it is safest to travel across the often inhospitable waters that lives depend on. Despite their usefulness, they are viewed with caution and distrust, as their methods of divination seem otherworldly and strange.

The Black Salt Seers have a complicated relationship with other religious institutions, such as the Stormcaller Synod and the Aquarian Rainwardens. As a secretive group, they may be seen as outsiders or even heretics by some, but revered by those who recognize the power and importance of the ocean in daily life.

The Black Salt Seers play a role in the city's class divide, as they provide guidance and omens that can help those who travel across the seas. However, lower-class people rarely encounter a Black Salt Seer unless particularly tenacious, as this is a secretive group not easily accessible.
