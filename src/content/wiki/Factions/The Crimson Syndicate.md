## Crimson Syndicate

The Syndicate is a banner draped over a dozen crews that learned cooperation pays better than knife work alone. Dock thieves, ledger forgers, and stormrunners all tithe into the crimson ledgers. Whispers claim nobles bankroll half their jobs and Syndicate brokers slip agents into house guard posts in return. Help them move contraband or expose a traitor and you earn smugglers' routes, silent fences, and favours that reach into parlours no badge could breach.

### Joining Perk

Members gain access to smuggling routes, black market contacts, and safe houses throughout the lower wards.

### Once-Per-Session Perk

Reveal a nearby safehouse or fence within a five-minute walk that can hide you or move contraband quietly.

### Criminal Network

The Crimson Syndicate operates throughout Stormhaven, involved in smuggling, extortion, and information brokering. They are often at odds with the city guard and legitimate merchants, but their influence runs deep. The Syndicate may have gained their name from the crimson-colored seaweed found in the depths around Stormhaven, highly sought after for its medicinal properties.
