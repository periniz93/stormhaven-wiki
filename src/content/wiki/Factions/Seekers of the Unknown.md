## Seekers of the Unknown

Explorer guilds comb the Underbelly and drowned archives. They bargain in maps, rumours of breaches, and the promise of a name etched in the registry of discoveries. Bring back proof from below and they will trade guides, safehouses, and the next lead into untouched vaults.

### Joining Perk

Members gain access to maps of the Underbelly, safe houses in lower wards, and contacts who deal in recovered relics and ancient knowledge.

### Once-Per-Session Perk

Ask, "What's the safest way in or out?" and receive a short, true route or the cost to make it safe.

### Explorer Culture

The Seekers hold a distinctive position in Stormhaven, reminiscent of legendary arena fighters who achieved fame through their battles. These intrepid explorers venture into the depths of the Underbelly in search of valuable artifacts and hidden knowledge. Upon their return, they often provide their findings to the nobility and the Artificers, who use these recovered treasures to enhance their status and research.

However, their pursuits also bring them into conflict with the Crimson Syndicate and other groups who see the city's subterranean realms as their own domains. Successful Seekers who return home are celebrated as heroes, their extraordinary tales capturing the imagination of Stormhaven's populace.

Many mercenary and adventuring groups start out or end up as Seekers.

### Dwarven Seekers

Dwarves make up a significant portion of the Seekers of the Unknown. They come from distant lands, drawn to Stormhaven by the thrill of exploring its mysterious underground. Some dream of finding a hidden path beneath the earth that connects back to their distant homelandâ€”a bold and risky idea driven by their longing for connection and discovery.
