The Storm Mother Temple District, also known as the Eye of the Storm, is a sacred area within Stormhaven dedicated to the worship of the Storm Pantheon. The district is home to the grand temple of the Stormcallers, which serves as their headquarters and the center of their religious activities. The temple is a massive structure made of stormglass and adorned with intricate carvings that depict scenes from Stormhaven's history.

The Eye of the Storm is also home to several smaller temples and shrines dedicated to other deities of the Storm Pantheon. These include temples to the Twins (lightning and insight), Zephyr (trade winds and chance), Aquaria (rain and healing), and Leviathan (depth and cycles). These smaller temples are often overlooked by visitors but hold great significance for those who worship these deities.

In addition to its religious significance, the Eye of the Storm is also a hub for unorthodox activities that attract adventurers from all over. The district is home to several underground fighting pits where fighters compete in brutal matches for fame and fortune. These fights are often held during storms when the power of Arc enhances the combatants' abilities.

The Eye of the Storm also has a reputation for being a place where one can find rare and exotic goods. Traders from all over come here to sell their wares, including enchanted jewelry that harnesses Arc in unique ways, rare artifacts that have been uncovered by Seekers of the Unknown, and even illegal substances that can enhance one's connection to Arc.

However, adventurers should be warned that not all who come to the Eye of the Storm do so with good intentions. There are rumors of secret cults that worship dark deities associated with storms and use forbidden magic to gain power over others. Those who venture too deep into these cults' lairs may find themselves in grave danger.

While it may seem like a peaceful religious district on the surface, the Eye of the Storm is a place of great complexity.
