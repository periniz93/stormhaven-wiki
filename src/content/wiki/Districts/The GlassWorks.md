The Arc Foundry: This district is home to massive stormglass furnaces that are used to smelt and refine raw Arc into usable forms. The artificers here work tirelessly to create new and innovative ways to use Arc in their creations, from enchanted jewelry to powerful magical artifacts.

The Artificers: The Artificers are a powerful guild of artisans and engineers who specialize in creating magical artifacts that harness the power of the storm. They are responsible for maintaining the city's stormglass infrastructure, which provides power to the city and protects it from the wrath of the storm. The Artificers are often at odds with the Stormcallers, who view their use of Arc as sacrilege.

The Foundry District surrounding the Beacon is a place where science and magic intersect, with Artificers working tirelessly to harness the energy of Arc and turn it into something tangible. Despite the Artificer's guild discouraging unsanctioned uses of Arc, inventors continue to push boundaries and experiment with new techniques. The district is full of creativity, ingenuity, and industrial strength, but also danger from rogue Artificers who use forbidden magic to enhance their creations beyond what is considered safe or ethical.
