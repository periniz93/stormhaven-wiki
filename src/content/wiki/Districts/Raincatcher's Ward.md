The district is home to a community of mystics and alchemists who have dedicated their lives to harnessing the power of the rain and using it to create wondrous works of art and technology.

Many of these mystics are followers of Aquaria, deity of rain and healing. They see their work in the Raincatcher's District as a form of devotion to Aquaria, using the power of rainwater to heal and nourish both people and crops.

The streets are lined with buildings that seem to grow organically from the ground, their walls covered in intricate carvings and mosaics that depict scenes from Stormhaven's history.

The Raincatcher's District is a place where magic and reality blur together in a beautiful tapestry of color and sound. It is a place where anything is possible if only you believe in it enough - a place where the followers of Aquaria can find solace and inspiration in the healing power of rainwater.

At the heart of the Raincatcher's District lies a sprawling complex known as the Aquarian Gardens. This vast network of gardens, greenhouses, and aqueducts is dedicated to the worship of Aquaria, deity of rain and healing.

The gardens are tended by a group of skilled farmers and healers known as the Aquarians. These devoted followers of Aquaria use their knowledge of agriculture and herbalism to grow crops and medicinal plants that are used to heal the sick and injured throughout Stormhaven.

The centerpiece of the Aquarian Gardens is a massive crystal dome that covers an enormous garden filled with exotic plants and flowers. The dome is said to have been created by ancient wizards who sought to capture the essence of rainwater in its purest form.

Inside the dome, visitors can see streams and waterfalls cascading down from above, nourishing the plants below. The air is thick with the scent of blooming flowers and herbs, creating a peaceful oasis in the midst of Stormhaven's perpetual rain.

The Aquarian Gardens are also home to a number of workshops where artisans create beautiful works of art inspired by nature. These artists often draw inspiration from the beauty and tranquility of their surroundings, creating intricate carvings, mosaics, and sculptures that adorn buildings throughout Stormhaven.

The Raincatcher's District is a place where magic and nature come together in perfect harmony. It is a place where followers of Aquaria can find solace in her healing power while surrounded by beauty and wonder.
