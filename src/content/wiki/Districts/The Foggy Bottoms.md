The Foggy Bottoms is a district shrouded in perpetual mist, where residents must navigate treacherous swamps and bogs to get around. The district is located on the outskirts of the city, and is known for its isolation and rugged terrain.

Despite its inhospitable environment, the Foggy Bottoms is home to a diverse group of people who have learned to adapt to their surroundings. Many are skilled hunters and trappers, who make their living by selling furs and other animal products. Others are farmers or fishermen, who rely on the district's rich soil and abundant waterways to sustain themselves.

The Foggy Bottoms is also home to several unique communities that have developed their own customs and traditions over time. One such community is the Marsh Dwellers, a group of people who live in small huts built on stilts above the swampy ground. They are skilled at navigating the treacherous terrain of the Foggy Bottoms, and are known for their ability to find rare herbs and other natural resources.

Another community in the Foggy Bottoms is the Bog Runners, a group of skilled boatmen who navigate the district's many waterways. They transport goods and people throughout the district, often braving dangerous rapids or avoiding hidden obstacles along the way.

Despite its rugged beauty, life in the Foggy Bottoms can be dangerous. The mist that shrouds the district can make it difficult to see more than a few feet ahead, making it easy to get lost or disoriented. There are also rumors of dangerous creatures lurking in the swamps and bogs, including giant snakes and other predators.
