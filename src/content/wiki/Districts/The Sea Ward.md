At the edge of the Sea Ward stands a towering lighthouse known as the Beacon's Echo. This magnificent structure is a testament to the ingenuity and skill of Stormhaven's engineers, who designed it to work in perfect harmony with the city's main Beacon.

The Beacon's Echo is so named because it echoes the light of the main Beacon, guiding ships safely into port even in the midst of Stormhaven's perpetual rain. Its bright light can be seen for miles around, serving as a beacon of hope for sailors who brave the treacherous waters off Stormhaven's coast.

The Sea Ward itself is a bustling district located on the eastern edge of Stormhaven, overlooking the vast expanse of the ocean. The district is home to a diverse community of sailors, fishermen, and traders who make their living on the sea.

Leviathan, deity of depth and cycles, is revered by all who live in the Sea Ward. The inexorable, watchful presence of this deity inspires both awe and respect in those who venture onto the open ocean. Sailors offer sacrifices and prayers to honor the cycles of the sea and seek blessings for safe voyages.

The streets are lined with shops and stalls selling all manner of goods, from fresh seafood to exotic spices and textiles from far-off lands. The air is thick with the scent of saltwater and fish, as fishermen bring in their daily catch to be sold at market.

At the heart of the Sea Ward lies a massive harbor filled with ships of all shapes and sizes. The harbor is constantly abuzz with activity as sailors load and unload cargo, repair their vessels, and prepare for their next voyage.

The Sea Ward is also home to a number of temples dedicated to Leviathan. These temples are often adorned with intricate carvings depicting the coiled sea serpent, and are frequented by sailors seeking blessings for safe voyages. Common offerings include lanterns set adrift beyond harbour lights.

The Sea Ward is a place where commerce and adventure come together under Leviathan's watchful eye.
