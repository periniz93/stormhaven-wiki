## The Beacon

Rising from the heart of the storm, the Beacon is a single tower of stormglass and brass. No one lives inside; the life happens in the ring of furnaces, workshops, and alleys that circle its base—collectively called The GlassWorks.

Here, the air tastes of hot glass and ozone. Vast furnaces roar day and night, refining raw lightning into bottled Arc. Artificers in iron masks tend crucibles, while apprentices dash between workshops with tongs still glowing. The work is lucrative and perilous: a cracked furnace can level a street, and rogue tinkerers have been known to vanish after midnight experiments.

The Beacon belongs to the Artificers' Guild, a breakaway order of Stormcaller Synod clergy who traded liturgy for engines generations ago. In the dawn days, cloistered priests coaxed lightning through ritual bronze spires, bottling charge for sanctuaries a vial at a time.

When the brightest among them laced the tower with induction coils and roaring furnaces—doubling its harvest and firing whole districts—the high Synod declared the work reckless heresy. The would-be artificers broke from sanction, proved their engines, and never came back.

Their charter is stamped by the Conclave rather than any temple, and guildmasters answer to ledgers, not omens. They still revere the sacred blueprints kept in the inner vaults, yet prayers have been replaced by calibration chants and lightning-scarred saints by master engineers. To the faithful, the Guild are prodigal kin; to the city, they are the only hands trusted to keep the Beacon burning.

### Stormglass

Stormglass is alchemically treated crystal that channels Arc safely. Handling raw Arc risks severe burns and catastrophic discharge.

### Getting In & Out

- **Night shift only** — Inner galleries open to Artificers, Conclave envoys, or noble escorts. Walk furnace-lit corridors where raw lightning is poured like glass.
- **Synod Observers** — Priests still keep vigil from gallery alcoves, offering omens unasked. Guild stewards tolerate them so long as no ritual interferes with the machines.
- **Worker's chit** — Foundry gates admit you one hour before dawn; flash the tin disc or pay 2 sp to the gate sergeant.
- **Outer Beacon Ladders** — Iron rungs and platforms bolted to the tower's spine. Guild plaques declare the climb forbidden; the brave and the crazy ignore them. After dark, illicit duels are fought on the slick rails for street cred.

### Arc Trade

### Respecting Arc

#### Arc Hazards

Touching raw Arc deals 2d6 lightning damage and leaves an arc-scar. While scarred, you suffer disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks with guild or temple officials.

#### Clear the Scar

Complete atonement, work a week of supervised shifts, or secure sanctioned oversight to remove the mark.

#### Guild Claim

Without a license, every coil and vial belongs to the Beacon. Expect ledgers, permits, and names recorded for every favour. Unauthorized use brings fines, confiscation, or worse.

#### Carry Limits

Hauling more than one sealed vial draws patrol attention. Rivals tail crews flaunting Arc, waiting for a misstep.

#### Supervised Access

Hire a guild handler, petition the Eye for ritual oversight, or rent a sanctified workshop before you tamper with conduits.
