In Stormhaven, the constant wetness and moisture pose significant challenges for construction and sanitation. The city's innovative solutions and resources have allowed it to adapt to its unique environment, but these are not always available or sufficient to address the problems in all areas.

Innovative Building Materials and Techniques

-   Stormwood: A native tree species with natural resistance to water and rot, used as a primary building material. Like Cedar.Organization TeamOrg
-   Rainstone: Dense, non-porous rock quarried from nearby mountains, ideal for foundations, walls, and canal linings.
-   Floodglass: Magically-infused glass that repels water and minimizes condensation, used for windows and decorations.
-   Weathered mortar: Waterproofing agents mixed with traditional mortar, providing a tight barrier against moisture and water intrusion.
-   Mistshield paint: Water-resistant paint with magical additives, applied to exterior surfaces for added protection.

Sanitation and Drainage Solutions

-   Rainrun canals: Channels designed to carry rainwater and wastewater away from populated areas.
-   Stormsewers: Underground sewer systems lined with Rainstone, preventing contamination and the spread of disease.
-   Aqua-purifiers: Enchanted devices that magically cleanse the city's water supply, ensuring clean drinking water.
-   Sanitation squads: Magi who patrol the city, using air and water magic to maintain a healthy environment.

Challenges in Resource-Scarce Areas

-   Leaky roofs: Makeshift roofs that fail to keep rain out, leading to damp interiors and poor living conditions.
-   Clogged canals: Inadequate maintenance and waste disposal causing stagnant water, mold, and disease.
-   Substandard mortar: Regular mortar used instead of weathered mortar, resulting in weakened structures and water intrusion.
-   Unpurified water sources: Untreated water sources in areas with limited access to Aqua-purifiers, increasing the risk of waterborne illnesses.
-   Insufficient drainage: Poorly planned or under-maintained drainage systems causing frequent flooding.
-   Overcrowded living conditions: Dense parts of the city with limited access to proper sanitation facilities, exacerbating the spread of disease.
-   Unsafe construction: Buildings constructed without proper safety measures, increasing the risk of collapse during heavy rain or strong winds.
-   Informal waste disposal: Dumping garbage into canals or open spaces, exacerbating pollution and disease.
