Welcome to Stormhaven, a city of perpetual rain and ever-churning storm clouds. Its narrow canals and winding walkways are shrouded in mist, and the sound of rain tapping against the cobblestones echoes through the streets. The towering spires of the Singers' cathedrals and the [[Temple of the Stormcallers]] rise above the cityscape, their bells tolling through the endless storm. The cobbled streets that crisscross the city lead to its beating heart, the towering [[Beacon]], a massive structure that harnesses the power of the storm to provide light and energy to the city. But with great power comes great upheaval, and the rise of the Artificers' Guild, who maintain the Beacon and constantly seek to push the boundaries of magic and technology, has upset the delicate balance of power in the city.

Against this backdrop of political and social upheaval, the major religious institutions hold sway over the city's inhabitants, guiding them in rituals to appease the wrath of the mother storm and protect against her fury. But even they are not immune to the forces of change that buffet the city.

Beneath the surface of the religious institutions and political infighting, the city hides a darker side. The people of Stormhaven struggle to survive. They must navigate the cramped walkways and canals, avoiding the dangers that lurk in the shadows. They must placate the fickle mother storm, praying for her mercy while fearing her wrath. And they must contend with the constant rain and stormy weather, which can turn the city's streets into rivers and make travel treacherous. Meanwhile, the Crimson Syndicate's shadowy influence permeates the city's criminal underworld, while the Fogweavers and Black Salt Clerics lurk in the shadows, their mysterious powers and hidden agendas shrouded in secrecy.

As you make your way through the cramped walkways and under the flickering glow of the Beacon, you can feel the tension in the air, a sense of unease that permeates every corner of this rain-soaked metropolis. Will you be able to navigate the treacherous waters of Stormhaven and emerge unscathed, or will you become just another victim of its tumultuous currents? Welcome to where the storm never ends and the secrets run deep.
