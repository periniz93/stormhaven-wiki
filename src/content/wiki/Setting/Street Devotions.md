## Street Devotions

*A whispered coin is lighter than an iron tithe, yet the sky still hears it.*

Simple acts of devotion can earn brief blessings from the Storm Pantheon. These quick prayers take one minute to perform and grant immediate practical benefits.

### Street Devotions Table (d6)

| d6 | Simple Act | Minor Boon |
|----|------------|------------|
| 1 | Flick a copper into a gutter for Zephyr | Advantage on next Navigation or Persuasion (1 h) |
| 2 | Drive two identical nails into oak for the Twins | Advantage on next Investigation (1 h) |
| 3 | Touch rain to eyelids for Aquaria | Regain 1 hp or end a minor ailment |
| 4 | Trace cloud-glass spiral in soot for Storm Mother | Advantage on next STR or DEX save vs. wind/water |
| 5 | Float a paper lantern for Leviathan | Advantage on next Water Vehicles check before dawn |
| 6 | Tap forehead to a lightning rod for the Twins | Advantage on next INT check to decipher an omen |

### Mechanics

- **Time Required**: One minute per devotion
- **Holding Boons**: You can hold only one street-devotion boon at a time; claiming a new one ends the previous boon
- **Duration**: All unused blessings fade after a long rest

### Examples of Use

**Example 1**: Before attempting to convince a canal gondolier to accept lower fare, a character flicks a copper coin into the gutter and whispers Zephyr's name. For the next hour, they have advantage on their Persuasion check.

**Example 2**: A wounded character touches rainwater to their eyelids, invoking Aquaria. They immediately regain 1 hit point, enough to stabilize after a rough fight.
