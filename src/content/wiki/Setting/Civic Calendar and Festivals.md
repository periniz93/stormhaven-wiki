## Civic Calendar and Festivals

Stormhaven counts time in four forty-day "turns" rather than traditional months. Major festivals mark the passage of these turns and offer both observance and practical benefits to adventurers.

### The Calendar Structure

- **Four Turns**: The year is divided into four forty-day periods
- **Turn Names**: Rainturn, Thunderwake, Stormhold, and one unnamed turn
- **Civic Function**: Markets close at noon on major festivals. Work halts when gale sirens sound.

### Major Festivals

| Day & Turn | Festival & Practice | Adventurer Boon |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1 Rainturn | Rain-Blessing - Aquarian chants welcome spring shower | Reroll one failed disease save this turn |
| 14 Thunderwake | Thunder Vigil - Kite-knights ground lightning through copper towers | Prophetic hint or take 3d6 lightning damage |
| 33 Stormhold | Brightgrove Synapse - Choir sings beneath emerald aurora | Spell save DCs in city +1 for one day |
| Funeral (any) | Leviathan's Toll - Whale-bone bell rung per soul lost at sea | Skipping toll: -2 on navigation until appeased |

### Festival Details

#### Rain-Blessing (Day 1, Rainturn)
Aquarian clergy perform chants to welcome the spring showers. Adventurers who participate or observe gain the ability to reroll one failed disease save during the turn.

#### Thunder Vigil (Day 14, Thunderwake)
Kite-knights ground lightning through copper towers in a spectacular display. Those who participate may receive a prophetic hint or risk taking 3d6 lightning damage from the ritual.

#### Brightgrove Synapse (Day 33, Stormhold)
The choir sings beneath an emerald aurora. For one day following this festival, all spell save DCs within the city increase by +1.

#### Leviathan's Toll (Any Funeral)
When souls are lost at sea, a whale-bone bell is rung. Harbour business pauses until the toll is complete. Adventurers who skip the toll suffer -2 on navigation checks until they make proper appeasement.
