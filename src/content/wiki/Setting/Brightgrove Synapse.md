## Brightgrove Synapse

The Brightgrove Synapse (Day 33 of Stormhold) is a time of great significance for the Choir of the Eternal Harmony and the people of Stormhaven. On this night, the Choir gathers beneath the emerald aurora to perform the Endless Song, their music resonating through the bioluminescent forest north of the city walls.

It's the one night a year that regular people are allowed into the Grove, and their presence amplifies the forest's hum, heard from all over the city.

For the Choir, this is a sacred gathering where members synchronize their rhythms and vibrations, tapping into the full power of the Endless Song. As the night wears on, the music becomes more intense and participants attune to the frequency of the cosmos.

For the people of Stormhaven, the Brightgrove Synapse is a time of celebration. Many businesses and merchants open their doors late into the night to serve revelers, and the streets are filled with music, dancing, and vibrant colors. The festival marks renewal and the transition between seasons.
