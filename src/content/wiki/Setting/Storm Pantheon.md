## Storm Pantheon

The five deities of Stormhaven's pantheon govern the forces that shape the city's daily life. Every roof-tile, sky-bridge, and canal wall stands because rites keep the weather civil.

### The Five Deities

| Deity | Symbol | Aspect | Portfolio | Offering |
|-------|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Storm Mother | Cloud-Glass Spiral | Majestic, Merciless | Fury, Renewal | Dark pearl cast into deep water |
| The Twins | Paired Silver Bolts | Ecstatic, Impulsive | Lightning, Insight | Two nails driven side-by-side in oak |
| Aquaria | Open Nautilus Shell | Serene, Nurturing | Rain, Healing | Bowl of fresh rainwater over river stones |
| Zephyr | Copper Vane | Capricious, Buoyant | Trade Winds, Chance | First-voyage coin flicked to the wind |
| Leviathan | Coiled Sea Serpent | Inexorable, Watchful | Depth, Cycles | Lantern set adrift beyond harbour lights |

### Why Devotion Matters

Temples harvest Arc for heat and light; citizens offer prayers for safe streets and steady trade. A few coins, a whispered vow, or a drop of blood can sway the storm.

Habitual neglect invites minor curses or roaming storm spirits.
