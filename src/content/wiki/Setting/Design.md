Despite the harsh conditions, the people of Stormhaven have adapted to their environment and built a unique culture that revolves around the ever-present storm. The city's architecture is designed to withstand the relentless rain and raging winds, with buildings made of sturdy materials, sloping roofs, and arched bridges connecting the various districts. Stormhaven's citizens wear waterproof clothing made from special fabrics that keep them dry, and they have developed unique forms of transportation like gondolas and rain runners â€“ amphibious creatures that can navigate the flooded streets with ease.
