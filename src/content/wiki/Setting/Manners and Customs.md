### Daily Realities

- Versa-cloaks hang from every peg, stitched from stormproof sailcloth with weighted hems so gusts don't flip them; they get rewaxed at dawn and rewarmed over coal pans before night patrols.
- Eel pies, fried canal shrimp, and cinderfruit cakes steam beside lift gates. Warmth Halls trade soup for gossip, while tower folk keep everwarm hearths roaring.
- When the Beacon sputters, shutters slam and rival crews settle scores before the lights return. The watch assumes anyone loitering near a conduit is casing the plates.
- Arc discipline keeps the terraces alive. Crews stash spare rope, tarps, and grounding spikes, assuming the next squall will turn a routine walk into a scramble.
