### Transportation

#### Rain-Runner Lizard
**Cost**: 4 sp/day

Four silver buys a day of sure-footed passage through flooded alleys and up steep inclines. These trained lizards can navigate terrain that would bog down wagons or horses.

#### Canal Craft

- **Open Pole-Skiff** (1 sp) - One weather-beaten gondolier, no canopy, knees in the bilge. Dockers, crab pickers, and night-scavengers ride shoulder-to-shoulder with cargo crates.
- **Half-Canopied Barge** (5 sp) - Waxed canvas keeps the rain off, there might even be a place to warm your feet. Clerks, artisans, or junior Wardens buy benches; the gondolier expects exact fare.
- **Closed Storm-Gondola** (2 gp or a house token) - Stormglass windows, brass lamps, velvet cushions. Noble heirs and silk merchants glide alone; the gondolier wears the house colors and never speaks unless spoken to.
- **Flood Hours** - Every craft rises in price during floods.

#### Sky-Bridge Lifts

**Lift Fare**: Free for the right sigil; 10 cp otherwise. You'll be turned away after dark without a house token.

**Storm Shutdown**: Closed during gale-force winds or lightning. Steam-driven cages that rattle between the upper terraces boarded in dripping alcoves.
