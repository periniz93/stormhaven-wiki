## Weather Rules

Stormhaven's eternal tempest creates constant environmental challenges. These rules apply whenever characters venture into the rain, wind, and lightning that define the city.

### Rules of Thumb in the Rain

#### Ranged Combat
Heavy rain imposes disadvantage on ranged attacks beyond 30 feet unless the weapon is built for storms.

#### Resting
Short rests taken outside require cover or a DC 12 Survival check to keep gear dry. Failure can result in damaged equipment, wet supplies, or exhaustion.

#### Movement
Flooded steps demand a DC 12 Acrobatics check or the character ends the move prone. This applies to stairs, ramps, and any inclined surface covered in water.

#### Climbing
Securing ropes or spikes grants advantage on Athletics checks during gale-force winds. Without such precautions, climbers face standard difficulty or worse.

### Weather Effects by Type

#### Heavy Rain
- Disadvantage on ranged attacks beyond 30 ft
- Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight
- Extinguishes open flames
- Lightly obscures the area

#### Gale-Force Winds
- Difficult terrain for movement
- Disadvantage on ranged weapon attacks
- Disperses fog and mist
- Can extinguish protected flames on a failed DC 10 check

#### Lightning Storms
- Sky-bridge lifts shut down
- Risk of lightning strikes in exposed areas
- Advantage on Perception checks to spot approaching weather (brief flashes illuminate surroundings)

### Environmental Hazards

#### Flooding
- Canal levels rise unpredictably
- Ground-level streets become difficult terrain
- Transportation prices increase
- Sluice gates may slam shut, blocking passage

#### Exposure
- Extended exposure requires Constitution saves against exhaustion
- Proper gear (like Versa-Cloaks) grants advantage on these saves
- Warmth Halls and covered areas provide respite

### Arc Discipline

The city survives through careful management of Arc-powered infrastructure. During severe weather:
- Crews deploy emergency equipment (rope, tarps, grounding spikes)
- Citizens retreat to covered terraces
- The watch becomes more vigilant around Arc conduits
- Unauthorized tampering with weather-protection wards is treated as a capital offense
