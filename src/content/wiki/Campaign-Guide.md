# Rain, Relics, and Razor-Thin Loyalty

Stormhaven is a city shaped by endless storms—a labyrinth of rain-slick alleys, glowing canals, and towering terraces beneath clouds that rarely, if ever break. At its heart stands the *Beacon*, a massive spire of stormglass and brass that channels lightning into a lifeblood called *Arc*. That power fuels lifts, furnaces, lamps, and the wards that hold floods at bay.

The upper terraces glimmer with wealth and light. Noble scions stride dry and scenic balconies, their cloaks aglow with jewels that sip Arc as casually as wine. Below, families cling to flooded shanties, burning driftwood against the chill and praying the next deluge will not carry their homes away. Secrets abound—contraband stormglass, drowned shrines whispering dark bargains, and relic-hunters emerging from the ancient city's many underground paths, collectively known as the Underbelly, clutching artifacts best left undisturbed.

Stormhaven began as a city of prayer: clerics pleasing the Storm Gods and gaining their protective Favor. Uncontent with the status quo, artificers split from the church and turned the storm into fuel. Their machines lifted the terraces; the priests still call every borrowed spark a debt. The city now teeters between mortal innovation and the fury of slighted gods.

Stormhaven's rain remembers every promise—and every betrayal. Choose your allies wisely, mind your footing, and keep your cloak close.

# Features of Stormhaven

- **Unending Tempest** — rain, sleet, and forked lightning shape every plan and every roof.
- **The Storm's Theft** — lightning is channeled into guild-marked stormglass bottles, wards, and curio, while the Synod rail against those who forget the old ways.
- **Devotion in Every Stone** — rites nearly old as the city itself lace its terraces, keeping the wards intact and the shrines fed.
- **Tradition's Grip** — seashell charms sway in doorways; alley shrines keep tallies of promises and grudges alike.
- **Vertical Society** — each step uphill buys drier floors, thicker doors, and more eyes watching the street below.
- **Ancient Depths** — dwarf-cut sluices, drowned basilicas, and the Underbelly's vaults gnaw beneath the cobbles.
- **A City for the Bold** — relic-hunters, sellswords, and scholars chase fortune through flooded tunnels and lightning-lit skies.

## Weather, Arc, and Daily Life

A steel-grey ceiling of clouds circles the city, broken only by the Beacon's blue-white pulse. Thunder feeds the tower; Arc runs through crystal capillaries into furnaces, stormglass lanterns, and ward-stones that keep the terraces afloat.

### Rules of Thumb in the Rain

- **Ranged.** Heavy rain imposes disadvantage on attacks beyond 30 ft. unless the weapon is built for storms.
- **Rest.** Short rests outside need cover or a DC 12 Survival check to keep gear dry.
- **Movement.** Flooded steps demand a DC 12 Acrobatics check or you end the move prone.
- **Climb.** Securing ropes or spikes grants advantage on Athletics checks during gale-force winds.

### Daily Realities

- Versa-cloaks hang from every peg, stitched from stormproof sailcloth with weighted hems so gusts don't flip them; they get rewaxed at dawn and rewarmed over coal pans before night patrols.
- Eel pies, fried canal shrimp, and cinderfruit cakes steam beside lift gates. Warmth Halls trade soup for gossip, while tower folk keep everwarm hearths roaring.
- When the Beacon sputters, shutters slam and rival crews settle scores before the lights return. The watch assumes anyone loitering near a conduit is casing the plates.
- Arc discipline keeps the terraces alive. Crews stash spare rope, tarps, and grounding spikes, assuming the next squall will turn a routine walk into a scramble.


---

## Getting Around

### Surface Slog

Stone lanes sit slick with silt. Wagons bog and hooves split, so most folk keep to the raised planks or hire a runner lizard to ferry them through flooded alleys.

- **Mud-Slog** – On the wrong day, each step attracts more muck; untreated boots will rot before the week is out.
- **Rain-Runner Lizard** – Four silver buys a day of sure-footed passage through flooded alleys and up steep inclines.
- **Sluice Gates** – When storm gutters back up, district gates will slam shut. Make a friend among the Gutter Wardens and they'll crank the wheel for you—or learn to wade.

### Canal Craft

Canals are the city's veins, and how you move on them is decided by coin, custom, and the cut of your cloak.

- **Open Pole-Skiff** (1 sp) – One weather-beaten gondolier, no canopy, knees in the bilge. Dockers, crab pickers, and night-scavengers ride shoulder-to-shoulder with cargo crates.
- **Half-Canopied Barge** (5 sp) – Waxed canvas keeps the rain off, there might even be a place to warm your feet. Clerks, artisans, or junior Wardens buy benches; the gondolier expects exact fare.
- **Closed Storm-Gondola** (2 gp or a house token) – Stormglass windows, brass lamps, velvet cushions. Noble heirs and silk merchants glide alone; the gondolier wears the house colors and never speaks unless spoken to.
- **Flood Hours** – Every craft rises in price. You never know who you'll be sharing a bench with when the water rises.

### Terrace Ramps & Stairs

Steep zig-zag flights bolted to tower walls. Wardlamp niches every twenty steps or so give guttering light. Guards collect tolls at landings and then vanish when the wind howls.

- **Guard Toll** – 2 cp or show a recognised sigil.
- **Broken Step** – DC 12 Dexterity save or fall prone.

### Sky-Bridge Lifts

Steam-driven cages that rattle between the upper terraces boarded in dripping alcoves. Brass gates slam shut at the first crack of lightning, and the operator counts the seconds between thunderclaps.

- **Lift Fare** – Free for the right sigil; 10 cp otherwise. You'll be turned away after dark without a house token.
- **Storm Shutdown** – Closed during gale-force winds or lightning.

**Secret Prompt:** You negotiated a truce between rivals—and kept the only copy of the contract.

---

### Exile or Outsider (Far Traveler, Hermit, Refugee)

---

## District Snapshots

These are some of the city's main districts. Each has its own watch, culture, and dangers. Think about where you lay your head.

| District | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Summit** | A cluster of towers crowns the city's spine, their balconies so close the storm feels caged. Nested sky-bridges knot between spires, strung like haphazard webs that sway when the Beacon flares. Expect Arc-lit salons, private guards, and balcony duels when tempers snap. |
| **Radiance** | Stormglass runoff paints the streets electric blue after dark. Artists and rogue Harmonists treat every wall as a canvas, but locals whisper that the glow bends dreams and sanity. Expect impromptu light shows, illegal arc-tricks, and sleepless nights. |
| **Raincatcher's Ward** | Terraced wetlands drip from hanging cisterns. Aquarian clinics offer free cures while bathhouses double as quiet political halls. Gardens bloom year-round under warm drizzle. |
| **Sea Ward** | Tide-scoured docks, Beacon's Echo lighthouse, and lantern-lit fish markets define the quay. Sailors swap storm stories as smugglers off-load illegal batteries under tarps. |
| **Foggy Bottoms** | Permanent mist shrouds stilted shacks and sinkholes ready to swallow streets. Trappers hawk swamp hides while rumours of albino eels keep youngsters indoors. Paths shift nightly with the flood; locals trust memory more than maps. |
| **The Eye** | Storm-glass cathedrals ring a plaza of daily rites. After sunset, sanctioned brawls roar beneath the nave, fighters laced in runed copper to channel static. |
| **The Grove** | Bioluminescent forest north of the walls sings with spores. The Choir of Eternal Harmony leads the Endless Song, drawing dreamers and chemists eager to bottle the glow. |
| **Underbelly** | Dwarf-cut sluices, relic vaults, and smuggler quays twist below. Maps change after every flood; Seekers pay dearly for guides who know the rising-water routes out. For most, it's a flooded maze best avoided. |

---

### Flashpoint: Lost Ward-Stone

A Sea Ward obelisk slumps after a midnight strike. Arc hisses across rain-slick streets while priests argue jurisdiction. Do you steady the stone, slip through exposed conduits, or brace for the tide?

---

### Where You Might Start

**Sea-Spray to Knee-Deep**
You wake beneath the Whale-Jaw Arch. *Going Up:* a skiff pole to Sea Ward, five copper to the lift gate, then the long wait— the Sky Bridges are closed to you unless someone with a badge vouches.

**Above the Worst Water, Below the First Sky-Bridge**
You rent the narrow box-bed in the choir loft above Radiance Nave. *Going Up:* the sky-bridge lift outside the bell tower climbs to the higher levels in two minutes if you bear the right seal. *Going Down:* the same lift drops to Underbelly via the spiral stair, no questions asked.

**High Enough for the Wind to Bite**
You lodge among glow-orchids in a StormGarden Glasshouse in High-Shelf. *Going Down:* a private cable-car rattles to upper reaches gate in minutes.


---

## Factions in Brief

Moments of tension drag every banner into the open. You'll be called upon to pick a side, or none at all.

### Why Alliances Matter

Stormhaven does not mourn the lost. Pledging to a faction means more than a badge; it buys eyes in the rain, a cot when your wounds reopen, and friends who will drag you off the cobbles before the gutters do. The city will not shed a tear if you vanish—make sure someone is watching your back.

---

### Join Perks at a Glance

| Faction | Once-Per-Session Edge |
|---------|----------------------|
| Stormcaller Synod | Calm a willing creature's mind: end frightened or charmed by offering counsel and a shared prayer. |
| Artificers' Guild | Declare an on-hand tool or part that keeps a device running for one scene, even if it should be broken or drained. |
| Great Houses | Call in a house token for safe lodging, a guarded carriage, or a sealed invitation within your patron's influence. |
| Seekers of the Unknown | Ask, "What's the safest way in or out?" and receive a short, true route or the cost to make it safe. |
| Crimson Syndicate | Reveal a nearby safehouse or fence within a five-minute walk that can hide you or move contraband quietly. |
| Ward Crews | Rally locals: treat the next crowd interaction as friendly unless you betray them this session. |
| Stormwatch | Flash your badge to suspend pursuit or questioning for one scene—paperwork catches up later. |

---

### Stormcaller Synod

Stormcaller Synod clergy keep the Eye's cathedrals and dozens of rain-houses across the wards. They mend souls, interpret omens, and broker absolution for storm-touched crimes. Even artificers must request access to temple fonts as petitioners—an everyday reminder that tending the faithful is a separate charge from running the city's engines.

---

### Artificers' Guild

The Guild claims every conduit and coil. Apprentice crews bottle Arc for paydays, while masters test inventions that could light wards—or level them. Impress them with salvage or a clever fix and they will trade tools, schematics, and discreet repairs, so long as you respect their ledgers.

---

### Great Houses and the Conclave

Stormhaven's elite society revolves around ten Great Houses, each guarding vast Arc reservoirs beneath its estate. Houses fund daring Underbelly expeditions, sabotage rivals, and host galas that double as battlegrounds for prestige.

Five senior patriarchs form the *Conclave*, a council regulating Arc distribution and issuing exploration licences. While individual nobles bankroll private ventures, the Conclave's favour—or withdrawal of it—decides which hunts rise or fall.

The *Artificers' Guild* walks a precarious line between clerical tradition and noble ambition. Guild masters grant technological favours to whichever patron preserves their independence, but they must at least publically abide by the strictures the Synod places on Arc-Tech development.

#### Summit Faces

- **"Vee" the Empty Purse** lingers at the back-door of the Mirror Salons, swapping tomorrow's guest list for a bowl of soup; buy her supper and she'll slip you an invite to the Prism Hall masque.
- **Calyx the Copper Duelist** leans on the First-Blood Balcony at dusk, selling scars for a copper apiece; hire him and you chalk the next name on the blade-board that hangs above the rail.
- **Pell the Pale** keeps a poison nook in Velvet & Vapor, a perfume lounge off the Grand Prom; swallow one drop and he owes you a favor richer than any sapphire.
- **Ash the Ledger Rat** works by candle in the Crow Loft above the Ledger Arcade, forging blank promissory notes; bring him a debt and he'll hand you a seal stamped at the Iron Quill.
- **Tally Voss** drifts through the Sky-Bridge Antechamber, court wig towering; if you need something inside tonight's Gilded Lantern gala, she already has it pinned among her hairpins.
- **Oria Rime the Ice Widow** breakfasts alone on the Frost-Rim Balcony of the Storm-Rider Club, reef-eel circling her glass trencher; show her a blood-stamped warrant and she'll loan you a squad of veterans for a week.

#### Flashpoint: Rogue Sky-Bridge

A commandeered cablecar arcs between High-Shelf towers, windows full of panicked riders. House Vane disavows it, the Guild wants proof, and the Syndicate smells tolls. Do you ground it, hijack it, or shepherd evacuees before someone cuts the cable?

---

### Seekers of the Unknown

Explorer guilds comb the Underbelly and drowned archives. They bargain in maps, rumours of breaches, and the promise of a name etched in the registry of discoveries. Bring back proof from below and they will trade guides, safehouses, and the next lead into untouched vaults.

---

### Crimson Syndicate

The Syndicate is a banner draped over a dozen crews that learned cooperation pays better than knife work alone. Dock thieves, ledger forgers, and stormrunners all tithe into the crimson ledgers. Whispers claim nobles bankroll half their jobs and Syndicate brokers slip agents into house guard posts in return. Help them move contraband or expose a traitor and you earn smugglers' routes, silent fences, and favours that reach into parlours no badge could breach.


---

## The Beacon

Rising from the heart of the storm, the Beacon is a single tower of stormglass and brass. No one lives inside; the life happens in the ring of furnaces, workshops, and alleys that circle its base—collectively called The Glassworks.

Here, the air tastes of hot glass and ozone. Vast furnaces roar day and night, refining raw lightning into bottled Arc. Artificers in iron masks tend crucibles, while apprentices dash between workshops with tongs still glowing. The work is lucrative and perilous: a cracked furnace can level a street, and rogue tinkerers have been known to vanish after midnight experiments.

The Beacon belongs to the *Artificers' Guild*, a breakaway order of Stormcaller Synod clergy who traded liturgy for engines generations ago. In the dawn days, cloistered priests coaxed lightning through ritual bronze spires, bottling charge for sanctuaries a vial at a time.

When the brightest among them laced the tower with induction coils and roaring furnaces—doubling its harvest and firing whole districts—the high Synod declared the work reckless heresy. The would-be artificers broke from sanction, proved their engines, and never came back.

#### Stormglass and You

Stormglass is alchemically treated crystal that channels Arc safely. Handling raw Arc risks severe burns and catastrophic discharge.

Their charter is stamped by the Conclave rather than any temple, and guildmasters answer to ledgers, not omens. They still revere the sacred blueprints kept in the inner vaults, yet prayers have been replaced by calibration chants and lightning-scarred saints by master engineers. To the faithful, the Guild are prodigal kin; to the city, they are the only hands trusted to keep the Beacon burning.

---

### Arc Trade

| Who | What You Get | Price |
|-----|--------------|-------|
| Guild Booth | Sealed vial, legal receipt | 25 gp |
| Back-alley Tinker | Cracked vial, no questions | 10 gp |
| Apprentice's Pocket | Thumb-sized dose, warm | 5 gp |

---

### Getting In & Out

- **Night shift only** — Inner galleries open to Artificers, Conclave envoys, or noble escorts. Walk furnace-lit corridors where raw lightning is poured like glass.
- **Synod Observers** — Priests still keep vigil from gallery alcoves, offering omens unasked. Guild stewards tolerate them so long as no ritual interferes with the machines.
- **Worker's chit** — Foundry gates admit you one hour before dawn; flash the tin disc or pay 2 sp to the gate sergeant.
- **Outer Beacon Ladders** — Iron rungs and platforms bolted to the tower's spine. Guild plaques declare the climb forbidden; the brave and the crazy ignore them. After dark, illicit duels are fought on the slick rails for street cred.

---

### Respecting Arc

#### Arc Hazards

Touching raw Arc deals 2d6 lightning damage and leaves an arc-scar. While scarred, you suffer disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks with guild or temple officials.

#### Clear the Scar

Complete atonement, work a week of supervised shifts, or secure sanctioned oversight to remove the mark.

#### Guild Claim

Without a license, every coil and vial belongs to the Beacon. Expect ledgers, permits, and names recorded for every favour. Unauthorized use brings fines, confiscation, or worse.

#### Carry Limits

Hauling more than one sealed vial draws patrol attention. Rivals tail crews flaunting Arc, waiting for a misstep.

#### Supervised Access

Hire a guild handler, petition the Eye for ritual oversight, or rent a sanctified workshop before you tamper with conduits.


---

## Faith and Festivals

"*Rain never asks permission; the devout do.*" — quay-wall inscription

### Storm Pantheon

| Deity | Portfolio | Symbol | Aspect | Common Offering |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Storm Mother | Fury, Renewal | Cloud-Glass Spiral | Majestic, Merciless | Dark pearl cast into deep water |
| Zephyr | Trade Winds, Chance | Copper Vane | Capricious, Buoyant | First-voyage coin flicked to the wind |
| The Twins | Lightning, Insight | Paired Silver Bolts | Ecstatic, Impulsive | Two nails driven side-by-side in oak |
| Aquaria | Rain, Healing | Open Nautilus Shell | Serene, Nurturing | Bowl of fresh rainwater over river stones |
| Leviathan | Depth, Cycles | Coiled Sea Serpent | Inexorable, Watchful | Lantern set adrift beyond harbour lights |

### Why Devotion Matters

Every roof-tile, sky-bridge, and canal wall stands because rites keep the weather civil. Temples harvest Arc for heat and light; citizens offer prayers for safe streets and steady trade. A few coins, a whispered vow, or a drop of blood can sway the storm.

---

### Street Devotions (d6)

*A whispered coin is lighter than an iron tithe, yet the sky still hears it.*

| d6 | Simple Act • Minor Boon |
|----|-------------------------|
| 1 | Flick a copper into a gutter for Zephyr — advantage on next Navigation or Persuasion (1 h). |
| 2 | Drive two identical nails into oak for the Twins — advantage on next Investigation (1 h). |
| 3 | Touch rain to eyelids for Aquaria — regain 1 hp or end a minor ailment. |
| 4 | Trace cloud-glass spiral in soot for Storm Mother — advantage on next STR or DEX save vs. wind / water. |
| 5 | Float a paper lantern for Leviathan — advantage on next Water Vehicles check before dawn. |
| 6 | Tap forehead to a lightning rod for the Twins — advantage on next INT check to decipher an omen. |

*A sincere act takes one minute. You can hold only one street-devotion boon at a time; claiming a new one ends the previous boon, and all unused blessings fade after a long rest.*

#### Flashpoint: Stormcaller Heresy

Masked preachers tuck pamphlets into pews, whispering that the Beacon owes absolution. The Synod readies raids, the Guild wants names, and unsponsored casters pack the back rooms. Do you spirit the faithful away, expose the ring, or let the rumor swell until zealots clash?

Word of rogue sermons spreads faster than official decrees, and the Eye weighs every response against the next stormfront.

> **Price of Impiety**: Habitual neglect invites minor curses or roaming storm spirits.

---

### Orders of the Faith

| Order | Joining Perk |
|-------|--------------|
| Stormcaller Synod | *druidcraft*; library access; oversight of wayward Artificers. |
