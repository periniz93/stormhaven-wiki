Lord Alastair Valtaris

Alastair Valtaris is a cunning and ambitious man who has long been the driving force behind the Valteri family's rise to power. He is a master strategist and has a reputation for being ruthless when it comes to protecting the family's interests. Alastair believes that the ends justify the means and is not above using any means necessary to achieve his goals.

Despite his love for Naim, Alastair sees her independent streak as a threat to the family's reputation and power. He often schemes to marry her off to someone who will bring the family even greater influence, regardless of her own desires. Alastair also disapproves of Naim's friendships with those outside of their social circle, believing that it could lead to weakness and vulnerability for the family.

Alastair's ultimate goal is to see the Valteri family rise to the highest echelons of power in Stormhaven, and he will stop at nothing to achieve it, even if it means sacrificing his own daughter's happiness.

 the values of loyalty, honor, tradition, and duty that the Valtaris family prizes do not necessarily preclude the cunning and ambitious values and shrewdness with which they conduct their public lives. In fact, these values can be seen as complementary to their strategic thinking and pursuit of power. The Valtaris family likely sees their ambition and shrewdness as a means of upholding their duty to protect and advance the interests of their family and maintaining the traditions of their noble lineage. However, it is worth noting that there may be some tension between these values at times, particularly if the pursuit of power conflicts with traditional notions of honor or loyalty.  
  
Ubertu Valtaris  
 

Appearance:

A slender man with slicked-back brown hair and sharp features. He wears fine, tailored clothing and exudes an air of confidence and charm.

Portrayal:

The man introduces himself as Ubertu of the Valteri, a distant cousin of Naim's. He seems friendly and welcoming, offering the player a warm smile and an invitation to join the family at the Brightgrove Synapse. He speaks with a smooth, persuasive tone that makes it hard to refuse.

Hook:

As the player interacts with Ubertu, they may notice a few hints that he's not entirely trustworthy. He seems overly interested in the player's assignment as a guard and makes some offhand comments that suggest he knows more than he's letting on. If the player investigates further, they might discover that Ubertu has ties to the people who are breaking into the temple and is using the Brightgrove Synapse as a distraction.
